## **README - DSA Practice Questions**  

### **ðŸ“Œ Overview**  
This repository contains a structured **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Question Bank** with **700+ coding problems** designed to help students and professionals prepare for coding interviews at top **MNCs (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.)**. The questions are divided into various topics, covering **basic to advanced** concepts.  

---

### **ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered**  
This question bank includes problems from the following **14 core DSA topics**:  

1. **Arrays**  
2. **Strings**  
3. **Linked Lists**  
4. **Stacks & Queues**  
5. **Recursion & Backtracking**  
6. **Trees**  
7. **Graphs**  
8. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
9. **Greedy Algorithms**  
10. **Hashing**  
11. **Bit Manipulation**  
12. **Heap & Priority Queue**  
13. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**  
14. **Segment Tree & Fenwick Tree**  

Each topic includes **easy, medium, and hard-level questions**, covering **commonly asked interview problems** as well as **trending DSA problems** from various online coding platforms.

### **ðŸ“Œ Recommended Practice Strategy**  
1. **Start with basic questions** to understand fundamental concepts.  
2. **Move to medium and hard questions** to improve problem-solving skills.  
3. **Focus on time and space complexity** while solving problems.  
4. **Revise previously solved questions** regularly to retain concepts.  
5. **Attempt coding contests** on platforms like **LeetCode, CodeChef, AtCoder, CodeForces** for real-time problem-solving experience.
